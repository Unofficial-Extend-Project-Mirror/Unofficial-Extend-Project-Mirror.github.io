Then the following script was used for hooking up the local clones of the repositories to the repositories (manually) created at Github: [associateReposToGithub.sh](https://github.com/Unofficial-Extend-Project-Mirror/scripts/blob/master/associateReposToGithub.sh)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor updating the local and remote mirrors later on:\r\n\r\n  1.
